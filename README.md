# LEO CubeSat - LEO CUBEX
This is a open source Low Earth Orbit CubeSat design completely ingrown as a initiative of Orbit, rocketetry club of NIT Tiruchirappalli.

## Standardisation
In 2017, standardization effort led to the publication of ISO 17770:2017. This standard defines specifications for CubeSats including their physical, mechanical, electrical, and operational requirements. It also provides a specification for the interface between the CubeSat and its launch vehicle, which lists the capabilities required to survive the environmental conditions during and after launch and describes the standard deployment interface used to release the satellites. The development of standards shared by a large number of spacecraft contributes to a significant reduction in the development time and cost of CubeSat missions.

## Technical Standards**
- Size of CubeSat 1U is 10 cm × 10 cm × 11.35 cm to provide 10cm x 10cm x 10cm of useful volume, the most common form factor is the 3U.
- Protrusions beyond the maximum dimensions are allowed by the standard specification, to a maximum of 6.5 mm (0.26 in) beyond each side. Any protrusions may not interfere with the deployment rails and are typically occupied by antennas and solar panels.
- No electronics form factors or communications protocols are specified or required by the CubeSat Design Specification, but COTS<sup>*</sup> hardware has consistently used certain features which many treat as standards in CubeSat electronics.
- Most COTS and custom designed electronics fit the form of PC/104<sup>*</sup>, which was not designed for CubeSats but presents a 90 mm × 96 mm (3.5 in × 3.8 in) profile that allows most of the spacecraft's volume to be occupied.
- All launched and deployed using a common deployment system called a Poly-PicoSatellite Orbital Deployer (P-POD), developed and built by Cal Poly.
- For very low Earth orbits (LEO) in which atmospheric reentry would occur in just days or weeks, radiation can largely be ignored and standard consumer grade electronics may be used. Consumer electronic devices can survive LEO radiation for that time as the chance of a single event upset (SEU) is very low. Spacecraft in a sustained low Earth orbit lasting months or years are at risk and only fly hardware designed for and tested in irradiated environments. 
- CubeSats often feature multiple computers handling different tasks in parallel including the attitude control (orientation), power management, payload operation, and primary control tasks. COTS attitude-control systems typically include their own computer, as do the power management systems. Payloads must be able to interface with the primary computer to be useful, which sometimes requires the use of another small computer. 
- CubeSats use solar cells to convert solar light to electricity that is then stored in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that provide power during eclipse as well as during peak load times
- Solar sails (also called light sails or photon sails) are a form of spacecraft propulsion using the radiation pressure (also called solar pressure) from stars to push large ultra-thin mirrors to high speeds, requiring no propellant.
- CubeSat electric propulsion typically uses electric energy to accelerate propellant to high speed, which results in high specific impulse. Many of these technologies can be made small enough for use in nanosatellites, and several methods are in development. Types of electric propulsion currently being designed for use in CubeSats include Hall-effect thrusters,ion thrusters, pulsed plasma thrusters, electrospray thrusters, and resistojets
- Many CubeSats use an omnidirectional monopole or dipole antenna built with commercial measuring tape
- Low Earth Orbit Cubesats use antennas for communication purpose at UHF and S-band
