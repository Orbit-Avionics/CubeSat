This project is interdisciplianry, following factors should be taken in consideration while designing

## Necessary specifications
- Form factor for a PCB must be 90mm x 96mm
- Battery powered satellite.
- Must be able to respond and ping back messages, a duplex communication should be established successfully.
- Should necessarily data log(Temperature, Pressure).
- Re-entry within days no need to consider radiation effects.
- A extension for connection should be provided for future expansion.


## Standards aimed to achive in future
- Multiple PCBs can be designed be interconnected using a ribbon wire, configuration must be specified. (The PCBs be stacked)
- In further development this system must be adapted to be completely powered by solar, so proper BMS system be designed.
- Radiation effects need to be factored in future endeavours.
- Able to acts as a node sending out beacons for connecting must be able to communicate with ground station.
- If communication lost it must be able to recover from it.

This version must be built such that Version 0.5 be built over it with very few additions, maybe adding few features or adding entirely other PCBs.
